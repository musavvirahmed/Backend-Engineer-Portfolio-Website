# Backend Engineer Portfolio Website

I made this back in [2016](https://dribbble.com/shots/2912175-Sajibasm-Personal-Landing-Page) for a developer colleague, who specialized in backend. I first came up with a custom design and suitable copy, then started building on it.

## What's In it?

* PSD file titled `backend_engineer_portfolio.psd` w/ all the design.
* Directory named `backend_engineer_portfolio` w/ all the front-end assets.

## What to do with it?

Whatever you want - go nuts! Just follow the [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) and play accordingly.
